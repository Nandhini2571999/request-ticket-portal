                <p>Congratulations! Your <b>Residence Visa</b> has been approved, and the process has been successfully completed.</p>

                <p>Please note that it is no longer necessary to provide your original passport to complete the Visa stamping process. 
                You will receive a notification once your <b>e-Visa stamping</b> is completed, after which you can easily download your 
                stamped e-Visa via the UAE ICP app.</p>

                <h4>How to Download e-Residence and Emirates ID Copies from the ICP App:</h4>
                <ol>
                <li>Download the ICP mobile application (Available in 
                    <a href="https://play.google.com/store">Play Store</a> and

                <h4>How to collect your Emirates ID card:</h4>
                <p>After your Emirates ID card is printed, the UAE Authority will send you a notification via SMS to your registered 
                mobile number. Once you receive this message, there are two options available for collecting your Emirates ID card:</p>

                <ol>
                <li><b>Direct to Your Location:</b> You can choose the option to have the Emirates ID sent to your location.
                    Once you receive the Emirates ID card, we request you to share a scanned copy of the card 
                    (both front and back sides) with us at 
                    <a href="mailto:documents@tascoutsourcing.com">documents@tascoutsourcing.com</a>.
                </li>

                <li><b>Through TASC:</b> Please share the SMS you receive from the UAE Authority with us at 
                    <a href="mailto:joiningauh@tascoutsourcing.com">joiningauh@tascoutsourcing.com</a>, 
                    so our PRO can collect your Emirates ID from the centre. 
                    You can then collect the Emirates ID from the TASC office.
